## Abstract
The healthcare web application is a comprehensive platform that integrates key domains and subdomains to optimize healthcare management. The recommendation system guides users through personalized disease recommendations based on symptoms, doctor recommendations linked to specific diseases, and tailored medicine suggestions. The medicine shop ensures a user-friendly process for obtaining prescribed medications. The scheduling of doctors streamlines appointment booking, enhancing accessibility to healthcare services. The e-prescription system digitizes and simplifies the prescription process. Digital health records provide a centralized repository for organized health information. The dashboard acts as a user-centric interface, offering a holistic overview of health data and facilitating seamless interactions across all features. This integrated approach aims to elevate user experience, efficiency, and overall health management within a user-friendly and accessible framework.

## Project Plan
The healthcare web application is designed with distinct subdomains, including a Recommendation System, Medical Shop, Schedules, and a Dashboard. In the Recommendation System, users can input symptoms to receive recommendations for possible diseases, doctors, and medicines. The system allows users to select a recommended disease, choose a doctor, view and select prescribed medicines, and generate an e-prescription. For the Medical Shop functionality, users can add medicines to their cart, proceed to checkout, and place an order. The system confirms the order, providing an order summary, and users receive confirmation along with delivery details. In the Schedules subdomain, users can view available doctors and select a preferred doctor. They can then choose a convenient time slot for an appointment, and the system confirms the appointment, sending a notification to the user. Additionally, users can check hospital entry schedules and plan their visits accordingly. The Dashboard serves as a centralized hub for users. After logging in, users can access personal healthcare records, e-prescriptions, and recommended medicines. The dashboard provides insights into upcoming.
